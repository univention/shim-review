  [ Steve McIntyre ]

  * In the -helpers-ARCH-signed packages, change the version
    dependency on shim-unsigned to be >= and not =. This will allow
    for installation to still work in the window while we wait for the

    our list of hashes at this point - they work out the same either
    way.
  * Switch to using gcc-9 for builds, tweaking a patch from upstream

  * Build using gcc-7 to get better control of reproducibility during the
    lifetime of Buster.
  * Build in a dbx list to blacklist binaries that we know to not be

  * Change maintenance address to be the EFI team
  * Add me and vorlon to the Uploaders list
  * Rename the helper binary packages to shim-helpers-$arch.
  * Update the signing-template JSON metadata to match new practice:

    + Add an empty "trusted_certs" key - the helper binaries do not do any
      further verification with an embedded key.

    - debian/control: add a Build-Depends on libelf-dev.
    - Enable arm64 build.
    - debian/patches/fixup_git.patch: don't run git in clean; we're not
      really in a git tree.
    - debian/rules, debian/shim.install: use the upstream install target as
      intended, and move files to the target directory using dh_install.
    - define RELEASE and COMMIT_ID for the snapshot.
    - Set ENABLE_HTTPBOOT to enable the HTTP Boot feature.
    - Update dh_auto_build/dh_auto_clean/dh_auto_install for new upstream
      options: set MAKELEVEL.
    - Define an EFI_ARCH variable, and use that for paths to shim. This
      makes it possible to build a shim for other architectures than amd64.
    - Set EFIDIR=$distro for dh_auto_install; that will let files be installed
      in the "right" final directories, and makes boot.csv for us.
    - Set ENABLE_SHIM_CERT, to keep using ephemeral self-signed certs built
      at compile-time for MokManager and fallback.
    - Set ENABLE_SBSIGN, to use sbsign instead of pesign for signing fallback
      and MokManager.
